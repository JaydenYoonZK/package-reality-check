# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ambient 3D background scene: a tumbling glass cube, tilted rotating ring, shaded floating sphere, and soft glow orbs, with gentle mouse parallax on desktop. CSS transforms only, hidden on small screens, adapted per theme, frozen under reduced motion.
- Sticky navigation bar with brand, section links that highlight as you scroll, and smooth anchor scrolling.
- Light and dark mode toggle, persisted across visits, honoring the system preference on first visit, with a ?theme= URL override.
- Animated header illustration in the suite's mini-window style, hidden on small screens to keep mobile content-first.
- Scroll-to-top button that appears after scrolling.
- Emoji accents on section headings.

### Changed

- Entrance and hover motion throughout (CSS only, respects reduced-motion preferences).
- Removed textarea autofocus so the page no longer loads scrolled past the header.

### Fixed

- Scroll-to-top button no longer turns dark on hover (it was caught by the generic secondary-button hover rule).
- Reference tables now scroll inside their own container on narrow screens instead of widening the page.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Paste and check button that reads the clipboard and runs the check in one step, with a keyboard-shortcut hint where clipboard access is restricted.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

First stable release.

### Added

- Browser checker for AI-suggested dependencies against npm and PyPI, with direct CORS requests and no middleman.
- Input parsing for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and raw JavaScript or Python source, with automatic input-type detection.
- Node built-in and Python standard library filtering (generated from `sys.stdlib_module_names`, plus modules removed in recent Python versions).
- Verdicts: PHANTOM (not in the registry), DANGER (new lookalike of a popular package), CHECK (young, low-download, deprecated, or near-name), OK.
- Typo distance checks against several hundred popular packages per ecosystem, with did-you-mean hints.
- Registration age (npm and PyPI) and monthly download counts (npm) as context.
- Dependency-free ES module engine (`docs/checker.js`) with 15 Node tests.
- `?demo` URL parameter that loads a sample with planted phantoms.
