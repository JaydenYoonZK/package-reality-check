## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

First stable release.

### Added

- Browser checker for AI-suggested dependencies against npm and PyPI, with direct CORS requests and no middleman.
- Input parsing for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and raw JavaScript or Python source, with automatic input-type detection.
- Node built-in and Python standard library filtering (generated from `sys.stdlib_module_names`, plus modules removed in recent Python versions).
- Verdicts: PHANTOM (not in the registry), DANGER (new lookalike of a popular package), CHECK (young, low-download, deprecated, or near-name), OK.
- Typo distance checks against several hundred popular packages per ecosystem, with did-you-mean hints.
- Registration age (npm and PyPI) and monthly download counts (npm) as context.
- Dependency-free ES module engine (`docs/checker.js`) with 15 Node tests.
- `?demo` URL parameter that loads a sample with planted phantoms.
